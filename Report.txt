What this code does:
All of minimal
All of core
All of completion
QuadTree in challenge
One feature implemented in challenge (scroll wheel to zoom)
Doesn't implement the polygons data file

Data structures that are used:
Trie - for search-box
Graph - for storing the nodes and edges
QuadTree - for efficiently querying the nodes upon click

I have tested my program by running the program over multiple iterations and ensuring that each feature works.
The QuadTree doesn't work as well as expected, and that may have to do with the fact that the capacity is 1. I
have not implemented any code that can legitimately support a capacity higher than that, since it simply grabs
the first node in the list the QuadTree returns when queried.
